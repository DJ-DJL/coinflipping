While watching this excellent video by Another Roof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QjgvbvFoQA
I wondered whether the problem of coin flips not being 50:50 can be solved by tossing two coins and calling "same" or "different" instead.
It then occurred to me that I can test this in code...


# My results:


| | |
|-|-|
| same      | 5001262255 |
| different | 4998737745 |
| sigma | 50000 |
| zScore | 25.2451 |

I a) don't trust my calculation and b) am unclear whether this comprehensively proves or disproves my hypothesis!
